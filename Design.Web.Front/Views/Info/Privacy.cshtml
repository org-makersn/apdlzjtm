        <dt>2. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</dt>
        <dd>MakersN and our service providers collect the following information from and about you:
Registration Information is the information you submit to register for a MakersN Service, for example, to create an account, post comments, receive a newsletter, or enter a contest or sweepstakes. Registration Information may include, for example, name, email address, gender, and birthday.

Public Information and Posts consist of comments or content that you post to the MakersN Services and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, status, profile information and picture. Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.

Social Media Information and Content. If you access or Sign-in to an MakersN Service through a third party social media service or another website, app, service or sign-in (“Other Service”), or connect an MakersN Service to Other Services, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that Other Service, any information or content you have permitted the Other Service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends’ lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that Other Service (collectively, “Social Media Information and Content”). When you access the MakersN Services through Other Services, or when you connect a MakersN Service to Other Services, you are authorizing MakersN to collect, store, and use any and all Social Media Information and Content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies), which are comprised of small bits of data that often include a de-identified or anonymous unique identifier may also be used. Websites, apps and other services send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer or other device so the website, app or other service can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that website, app or other service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the MakersN Services, such as pages you have visited, the contents you have viewed, search queries you have run and advertisements you have seen. Cookies may also be used by us or by our service providers to collect and store information on your use of other companies’ websites or services, such as sites you visit and materials you view.  We may merge this with other data we collect about you from third parties to assist us in our ability to provide the Services, including, without limitation, to advertise and provide content to you. Our work in this respect is compliant with the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Principles for the Self-Regulation of Online Behavioral Advertising.  

Third parties that support the MakersN Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate MakersN Services usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information when you use the MakersN Services or third party service. MakersN does not control these third party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.

        <dd>MakersN uses commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard information in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. However, no one can guarantee the complete safety of your information.  If you are asked to select a password to access a MakersN Service, you should select a password that contains a combination of letters, numbers and non-alphanumeric characters (for example, %, $ and &) and avoid dictionary words.

Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others and there may be a delay in the removal of the content from elsewhere on the Internet and from search engines. We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancelation for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies.
